Developed and tested a technology that allows users to communicate with the database directly using their natural speech to retrieve information. Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Lexical analysis, semantic analysis, syntactic analysis, discourse integration & Pragmatic analysis.

We developed an application with background noise suppression feature.
